I developed a web crawler to download 8892 landscape photos from <a href="https://wallpaper.mob.org/gallery/tag=landscape/">mob.org</a>.\n\nHowever, I ran up against difficulty in extracting the color features from the images. I was inspired by an assignment given by Professor Harvey. In the assignment, the material guides us to use the proportional of the channel to classify whether a certain picture depicts summer or winter. From this perspective, I searched some information online and was attracted by the concept of color histogram.\n\nTherefore, I designed my procedure as followings. Interestingly, I found a paper that has a similar approach to mine.<sup>[1]<sup>\n\nThe first step is quite obvious, to read the image as a three-dimensional matrix. The first and second dimensions are the count of rows and columns, and the third dimension is the color vector representing RGB, whose length is three. So it is basically an (N, M, 3) matrix.\n\nLet\u2019s take this picture as an example.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/sample.jpg" alt = "Sample">\n\nIn this picture, the blue, yellow, green and red color seems to be dominant. If we plot the pixels in three-dimensional space, the distribution will look like this.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/sample_color_scatter.png" alt = "Sample Color Scatter">\n\nSecondly, I count the frequency of the occurrence of primary colors and use it as the features of the images. Sometimes it is better to view the image in other color spaces, like HSV or HSL, which is more friendly to human\u2019s eyes. In this project, I still choose the RGB color space for simplicity.\n\nSince there are 256 possible values for a one color dimension, I transformed the value by dividing them with 26 so there will be 10 possible values for each color dimension, which will lessen the burden of calculation.\n\nThe third step is to apply the K-means algorithm to cluster the images. Here I write a scala script and run it on the spark, which will make four clusters. The color histogram of the cluster centers is shown in the figure.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/cluster_centers_hist.png" alt = "Cluster Centers Color Histogram">\n\nThe centers look separated from each other, which is indicating a good result to me. Hopefully, the different clusters can be distinguished by human eyes. I collected 400 images of each cluster and display them in the followings.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/400images_0.png" alt = "400images_0">\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/400images_1.png" alt = "400images_1">\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/400images_2.png" alt = "400images_2">\n<img src = "./figures/Landscape-Image-Clustering-Based-On-Color-Histogram/400images_3.png" alt = "400images_3">\n\nThey look great, aren\u2019t they? Each cluster appears to have a different color theme.\n\nReference:\n\n1. Amro, Anas Nassar, Ibrahim Tamimi, Hashem. (2013). Clustering of Digital Images based on Color Histogram.</li>\n2.

The story of The Hunger Games is narrated by the young girl, Katniss Everdeen. There are many characters in the story, and what I am going to do is to describe the connections between the characters from a data science perspective.\n\nThe data is the text of the <em>The Hunger Games I</em>, which is the first edition. My steps are listed as followings.\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nI use the nltk package, which is a natural language toolkit, to split the text into a token sequence. Then, I count the occurrence of the main characters.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Text-Co-Occurrence-For-Hunger-Games/characters_occurrence.png" alt = "Characters Occurrence">\n\nThe bar chart illustrates that Peeta is the most frequently mentioned person in the story. Haymitch, of course, as the mentor of Katniss and Peeta, is the second most mentioned person. Gale, who I thought would be the best candidate for the male lead when I read the first part of the book, actually plays a relatively minor role in the whole story.\n\n### Word Cloud\n\nThe fact that Peeta is the most frequently mentioned person can also be verified through the graph of a word cloud. It is evident that the word \u201cPeeta\u201d has a significant amount of occurrence in the book.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Text-Co-Occurrence-For-Hunger-Games/word_cloud.png" alt = "Word Cloud">\n\n### Text Co-occurrence Network\n\nTo describe the relationship between characters, I defined a text co-occurrence network. The definition is that if one name appears in the range of 100 words of another name, then the connections between the two names will increase one. For example, if we got Peeta in the token sequence, and Haymitch appears after 80 words, then the count of connection between Peeta and Haymitch will add one. Therefore, what we have here is a weighted undirected network.\n\nI use software Gephi to visualize the network. This software is fantastic, by the way.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Text-Co-Occurrence-For-Hunger-Games/network_graph.png" alt = "Network Graph">\n\nIt seems that there exists some redundancy in the network. Therefore, I removed all the edges whose count of co-occurrence is less than or equals three.\n\n<img src = "./figures/Text-Co-Occurrence-For-Hunger-Games/network_graph_greater_than_three.png" alt = "Network Graph">\n\nThis graph looks much better! The chart provides some interesting data regarding the relationship between the main characters. Those who have close relationship indeed have more frequent co-occurrence in the story. The people that do not show up together with others look more alienated in the network. That is consistent with our common sense. Why Peeta would spend his weekend with President Snow rather than Katniss or Haymitch?\n'}],g=(a(44),a(132)),p=function(e){function t(e){var a;return
